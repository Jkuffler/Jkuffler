# I'm Jason Kuffler

<b>Life-long student | Current: Mentor with Code the Dream </b>

In Beautiful Katamari the king of the universe says "Love makes the world go round...but manners keep you from getting motion sickness". I love that.

I thrive at high volume paces that involve cross collaboration. When there's downtime I like to research and experiment with all kinds of technologies, ideas, and problems.

I have wide ranging experience in the public sector over 20+ years of proven determination and creativity I can develop thorough solutions that come with genuinely humble communication skills.

In the tech industry I am honestly most excited about the different people I can meet who share a sense of belonging when they work on projects with an open mind. I'm passionate about personal discovery and persistently lifting the spirits of those around me.

To help people get right to the ice cream they'll love, or love to discover, the Iceium concept was submitted in 48 hour sprint. Development continues for dynamic map features calling from the Moogle API. üòÜ I am now a huge fan of getting into hackathons.
