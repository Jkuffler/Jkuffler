<b>Life-long student | Current: Mentor with Code the Dream </b>

In Beautiful Katamari the king of the universe says "Love makes the world go round...but manners keep you from getting motion sickness". I love that.

I am excited to tackle complex code and sharing more knowledge about creating remarkable web content. I participate and enjoy the team spirit of huddles, o3's or large calls. I'm passionate about discovering new fulfilling experiences and staying mindful of protecting nature's splendor - in ecosystems, and in court.
