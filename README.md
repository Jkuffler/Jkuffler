# :sunglasses: Howdy! I'm Jason Kuffler :sunglasses:

<b>Life-long student in meatspace and cyberspace</b>

I'm a recovering sales rep turned Dev cutting my teeth on JavaScript, React, and Ruby on Rails. I have proven Sales, Customer Service, and Leadership background. Interpersonal skills are a big deal to me. In Beautiful Katamari the king of the universe says "Love makes the world go round...but manners keep you from getting motion sickness". I love that.

I thrive at high volume paces. When there's downtime I like to research and experiment with new technologies, ideas, and problems.

Personal note: I prefer hunting down the next local/family business (or NPO) to support. Chain stores often lack that human element that is part of what I love about business.

I am driven to thoroughly assess client's needs and deliver exceptional solutions.

I'm passionate about personal discovery and persistently lifting the spirits of those around me. Normalize a culture of respect for all!

Especially in the dev community: humans are still among my favorite resources. Let's talk about design and syntax!
