# :sunglasses: Howdy! I'm Jason Kuffler :sunglasses:

<b>Life-long student in meatspace and cyberspace</b>

In Beautiful Katamari the king of the universe says "Love makes the world go round...but manners keep you from getting motion sickness". I love that.

I thrive at high volume paces that involve cross collaboration. When there's downtime I like to research and experiment with new technologies, ideas, and problems.

My experience with the public for 20+ years has shown that I am driven to deliver thorough solutions.

I'm passionate about personal discovery and persistently lifting the spirits of those around me. DEI is a way of life and I'm very pleased to feel a part of a more positive culture than in retail roles.

Especially in the dev community: humans are still among my favorite resources. Let's talk about open-source :)
