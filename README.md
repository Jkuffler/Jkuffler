<b>Life-long student | Current: Mentor with Code the Dream </b>

In Beautiful Katamari the king of the universe says "Love makes the world go round...but manners keep you from getting motion sickness". I love that.

In the tech industry I am excited to tackle complexities and continuously add more base knowledge of creating remarkable web content. I am also thrilled about the different people I can meet who share a sense of belonging when they work on projects together. I'm passionate about personal discovery and staying open-minded to new possibilities!
